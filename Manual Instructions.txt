----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Install Java by running "jre-8u281-windows-x64.exe" and proceeding through the Install Wizard

2. Install OptiFine by navigating to the folder you have the OptiFine_1.16.5_HD_U_G6.jar file
	In the navigation tab at the top of the file explorer, click in so it highlights the filepath, and type "cmd" then hit enter
	This will open a command prompt... do not fear, and no you are not a hacker now
	type the next line into the command line interface and hit enter:
	java -jar OptiFine_1.17.1_HD_U_G9.jar
	Click Install then OK then close the command prompt window

3. Boot in the OptiFine mode
	Open Minecraft Launcher
	Before you hit play for the Java Edition, there should be a little Minecraft Grass Block Icon and and text that says "Latest Release v1.17.1" or something
	Click that to open the dropdown window, and select "OptiFine: 1.17.1-OptiFine..."
	Now Hit Play

4. Install the Shader
	In Minecraft Java, while running the OptiFine Installation...
	From the Main Menu, select Options >> Video Settings >> Shaders
	Click the TEXT BOX that says Shaders Folder -> NOT THE LITTLE DOWNLOAD ARROW, that redirects you to a webpage
	Selecting the Shaders Folder Box should open a file explorer window with a path like:
	"...\.minecraft\shaderpacks"
	Drag and drop the Compressed/Zip folder "BSL_v8.1" into that shaderpacks folder
	A new option should have appeared in the Minecraft Shaders Interface, you had "OFF" and "(internal)"
	Select the new option that says "BSL_v8.1.zip"
	Minecraft will show a loading screen as it initializes the shader

5. Install Jerms Better Leaves Resource Pack
	Next, from the main menu go to Options >> Resource Packs
	Click "Open Pack Folder" at the bottom left
	Drag and Drop the "Better+Leaves+Add-on+V2.6-1.17.zip" compressed folder into the "resourcepacks" folder
	Close the file explorer window, and back in the Minecraft app, hover over the icon for Better Leaves that just appeared
	Click the little play arrow looking button to move it from the "Available" column to "Selected"
	You should get another loading screen as it initializes the resource pack, then you're done!!!

6. Enjoy

7. Realize that this isn't permanent
	With each release of minecraft (i.e. when they go to 1.17.2 from 1.17.1) we're going to have to do this again
	This is a good opportunity to learn how to do this yourself OR
	Bug Haley to bug me because I'll likely have downloaded the install files
