repository to build powershell script executable to update OptiFine, shader, and texture versions

Automation may or may not work. I tried using a new language and process and it doesn't seem to work on my machine.
Try one of the two things:
1. Run the executable file "MinecraftModder.exe" - it will prompt you to install Java, copy some folders for you, then open the "AfterRunning.txt" file
2. If the above doesn't work, right click "v1.18.2.ps1" and click "Run with PowerShell" this should do the same as the above

If none of that worked, sorry but you'll have to do it manually.
1. Open the file "Manual Instructions.txt"
2. Reach out if you're having trouble
