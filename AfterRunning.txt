If this openned after you ran that executable, everything should have worked.

Below are the last three steps. If the things I tell you to click in Minecraft aren't there, something went wrong. In the folder is a document with the old manual instructions I wrote. This file is aptly named "Manual Instructions.txt".

1. Boot in the OptiFine mode
	Open Minecraft Launcher
	Before you hit play for the Java Edition, there should be a little Minecraft Grass Block Icon and and text that says "Latest Release v1.18.2" or something
	Click that to open the dropdown window, and select "OptiFine: 1.18.1-OptiFine..." or something like that
	Now Hit Play
	* Minecraft Launcher will remember you booted in OptiFine mode next time, so you won't have to do this every time

2. Install the Shader
	In Minecraft Java, while running the OptiFine Installation...
	From the Main Menu, select Options >> Video Settings >> Shaders
	There should be an option in the Minecraft Shaders Interface that says "BSL_v8.1.02.2.zip" or something
	Click on that option
	Minecraft will show a loading screen as it initializes the shader
	Then go back to the Main Menu

3. Install Jerms Better Leaves Resource Pack
	Next, from the main menu go to Options >> Resource Packs
	Hover over the icon for Better Leaves
	Click the little play arrow looking button to move it from the "Available" column to "Selected"
	You should get another loading screen as it initializes the resource pack, then you're done!!!
